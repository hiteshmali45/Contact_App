# Contact App

## Overview
This project is a Python-based **Contact App**, designed to help users manage their contacts through a simple command-line interface. It demonstrates key programming concepts such as data structures, strings, regex, and file handling. This project focuses on understanding programming logic rather than user interface design.

## Features
The Contact App includes the following functionalities:
- **View All Contacts:** Display a list of all contact names.
- **Search Contacts:** Search for contacts by name using basic search logic.
- **View Contact Details:** View detailed information, including name, phone number, and email.
- **Update Contact:** Modify the details (name, phone number, and email) of an existing contact.
- **Delete Contact:** Remove a selected contact from the list.

## Data Structure
The app uses a list of dictionaries to store contact information. Each dictionary contains the following key-value pairs:
- `name`: The contact's name
- `number`: The contact's phone number
- `email`: The contact's email address
